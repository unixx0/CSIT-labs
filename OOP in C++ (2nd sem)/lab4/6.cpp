/*6. All the banks operating in India are controlled by RBI. RBI has set a well defined guideline (e.g.
minimum interest rate, minimum balance allowed, maximum withdrawal limit etc) which all
banks must follow. For example, suppose RBI has set minimum interest rate applicable to a
saving bank account to be 4% annually; however, banks are free to use 4% interest rate or to set
any rates above it.
Write a program to implement bank functionality in the above scenario. Note: Create few classes
namely Customer, Account, RBI (Base Class) and few derived classes (SBI, ICICI, PNB etc).
Assume and implement required member variables and functions in each class.*/
