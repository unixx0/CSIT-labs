/*5. Create a class named Shape with a function that prints "This is a shape". Create another class
named Polygon inheriting the Shape class with the same function that prints "Polygon is a
shape". Create two other classes named Rectangle and Triangle having the same function which
prints "Rectangle is a polygon" and "Triangle is a polygon" respectively. Again, make another
class named Square having the same function which prints "Square is a rectangle".
Now, try calling the function by the object of each of these classes.*/
